## The Plug 

### Notes for completing The Plug (pre-production)
- IPFS hashes need to be updated with **new JSON pins** (need to research "About" section)
  -> https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards'
- Convert to SafeMath?
- Restructure contracts based on what's been learned from zombies

### Notes for transitioning to Production
- New **Alchemy API key** (production version)
- Need to **deploy using our shared wallet** (not my personal MetaMask) - 
  so **update public/private keys**
- Need to setup `hardhat.config.js` for Ethereum mainnet 
- Switch logic from cycling the asset from every 2 hours to **every 2 months**

#### Post-production if anything
- Potentially write a script that LOGIK can execute on his own to obtain the list of
  level owners so that I don't need to do it for him every time he wants an updated list
- Script that can auto batch transfer the airdrops based on a list of addresses


## Citizens of the World
**Working on the assumption that all of these NFT's are basically unrelated unless viewed
on LOGIK's website**

### Passport
- `Passport` should have a mapping from owner addresses to stamp balances (bridged w/ the address 
for the collection), i.e. 
```
  // Passport.sol
  // mapping from owner addresses to stamp balances (bridged w/ the address for the collection)
  mapping (address => mapping(address => uint32[]) 
  // e.g.
  // 0xEab64..Gz9 => [0x8a..er3 => [0,1,1,0,0,0,1], ...]
  // means owner 0xEa.. has collected stamps 1, 2, and 7 from the collection at address 0x8a..
```

"The problem with this approach

This approach is tempting for its simplicity. But let's look at what happens if we later add a function to transfer a zombie from one owner to another (which we'll definitely want to add in a later lesson!).

That transfer function would need to:

    Push the zombie to the new owner's ownerToZombies array,
    Remove the zombie from the old owner's ownerToZombies array,
    Shift every zombie in the older owner's array up one place to fill the hole, and then
    Reduce the array length by 1.
"
-> The point is transfering ownership of stamps becomes difficult 
WAIT MAYBE.... MY APPROACH MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

- This means we need a function: 
	`awardStamp(address passportOwner, address stamp, uint256 stampId)`

- Maybe also:
	`awardCitizen(address passportOwner, address citizen, uint256 citizenId)`

- Normal functions I can think of:
	`beforeTransfer`
	`tokenURI` (the cover of the passport will be different if you own a character???)
	`mintPassport`

- *Does anything change if you also mint a character??? Or is this just the first page
  of the passport if so????*

### Stamp Collection
- This will communicate directly with `Passport.sol` in order to validate whether or not 
  someone is allowed to mint a stamp
- Each collection will be a new contract where NUM_PASSPORTS Stamps get minted
- The URI returned should never change, but should at least be unique on IPFS (API can handle
  this)
- Pretty sure these should be simple, while Passport is more complicated than I currently have 
  documented...

### Citizen
- The main thing with the Citizens is some sort of hash function that determines the URI (because 
  it will be a random, unique citizen determined by something like the minter's address)
- The API will be doing the heavy lifting as far as the logic is concerned 
  -> I think it needs to use the minter's address to assemble a Character (using layers) 
     and then in-turn pin it to IPFS using Pinata's API, then pin a JSON file that corresponds
     to it, and then deliver that final IPFS hash back to the contract for the URI.
- Maybe this also communicates with `Passport.sol` in order to "award" a Citizen

- Create a `CitizenFactory` that has a function to randomly generate a 16 bit number to correspond
  to the citizen's features
  e.g.
  ```solidity
  contract ZombieFactory {

    uint dnaDigits = 16;
    uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits;

    struct Zombie {
        string name;
        uint dna;
    }

    Zombie[] public zombies;

    function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) private {
        zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna));
    }

    function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) {
        uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str)));
        return rand % dnaModulus;
    }

    function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {
        uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
        _createZombie(_name, randDna);
    }

  }
  ```
  Then with javascript:
  ```javascript
    // Here's how we would access our contract:
	var abi = /* abi generated by the compiler */
	var ZombieFactoryContract = web3.eth.contract(abi)
	var contractAddress = /* our contract address on Ethereum after deploying */
	var ZombieFactory = ZombieFactoryContract.at(contractAddress)
	// `ZombieFactory` has access to our contract's public functions and events

	// some sort of event listener to take the text input:
	$("#ourButton").click(function(e) {
	  var name = $("#nameInput").val()
	  // Call our contract's `createRandomZombie` function:
	  ZombieFactory.createRandomZombie(name)
	})

	// Listen for the `NewZombie` event, and update the UI
	var event = ZombieFactory.NewZombie(function(error, result) {
	  if (error) return
	  generateZombie(result.zombieId, result.name, result.dna)
	})

	// take the Zombie dna, and update our image
	function generateZombie(id, name, dna) {
	  let dnaStr = String(dna)
	  // pad DNA with leading zeroes if it's less than 16 characters
	  while (dnaStr.length < 16)
	    dnaStr = "0" + dnaStr

	  let zombieDetails = {
	    // first 2 digits make up the head. We have 7 possible heads, so % 7
	    // to get a number 0 - 6, then add 1 to make it 1 - 7. Then we have 7
	    // image files named "head1.png" through "head7.png" we load based on
	    // this number:
	    headChoice: dnaStr.substring(0, 2) % 7 + 1,
	    // 2nd 2 digits make up the eyes, 11 variations:
	    eyeChoice: dnaStr.substring(2, 4) % 11 + 1,
	    // 6 variations of shirts:
	    shirtChoice: dnaStr.substring(4, 6) % 6 + 1,
	    // last 6 digits control color. Updated using CSS filter: hue-rotate
	    // which has 360 degrees:
	    skinColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(6, 8) / 100 * 360),
	    eyeColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(8, 10) / 100 * 360),
	    clothesColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(10, 12) / 100 * 360),
	    zombieName: name,
	    zombieDescription: "A Level 1 CryptoZombie",
	  }
	  return zombieDetails
	}
  ```
  Doing something with a zombie:
  ```javascript
  function getZombieDetails(id) {
	  return cryptoZombies.methods.zombies(id).call()
	}

	// Call the function and do something with the result:
	getZombieDetails(15)
	.then(function(result) {
	  console.log("Zombie 15: " + JSON.stringify(result));
  });

8.21.21. -

- NOTE: the `_squad` variable may be improperly used right now since I have that 
  Gnosis wallet (or whatever) ... it's useful for testing that's for sure

- Kind of want to try refactoring even more to make `KasbeerMade721` to handle a bunch
  of the stuff I'd want done for every ERC721 i make...


8.23.21  -

- Refactored the code and am now testing it ... all of the ownership logic, 
  custom hash stuff, and erc721 overrides have been taken out of `Plug.sol` 
  in order to focus more on the code that matters for this particular NFT
  -> so far so good
